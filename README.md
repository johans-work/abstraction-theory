# intro

An abstraction is any pattern used to represent another pattern, such as a name, a diagram, or a detailed description. Abstractions are meant to be used, and the use case determines the tolerance of how similar the expressions can be, and how they are physically implemented.




# the physics

All matter must have a shape. All shapes must be of matter. Abstractions are made of shapes, and are perfectly physical.

Every abstraction has an implementation, and an expression. 

The implementation is the physical nature of the abstraction. The ink on paper, the pixels on a screen, the clay, the hard disk, our memory, etc. 

The expression is the use case, that is meant to be observed and mean something.

The expression itself is often used for implementation, but this has little to do with the physical nature of the abstraction.

An instruction is an expression that causes the observer to do as instructed.

A schematic expresses an implementation.

A fact expresses a true description of the world.

A description of a cause expresses a theory.




# the laws

1. Every abstraction has an implementation. It's physical composition.

2. Every abstraction is an expression. It's observed composition.

3. Abstractions are shapes. The observation is shaped.

4. Abstractions have meaning. The shape is known.

5. Abstractions travel. Shapes are communicated across sound, paper, wires, and screens.

6. Abstractions are used. By those that know them.

7. Abstractions are defined. By those that use them.

8. Abstractions evolve. With use.

9. An abstraction is an abstraction, and never what it represents.

10. Abstractions are enacted. They substitute the real thing and are made consequential.

11. Abstractions can be counted.

12. Abstractions can be copied.

13. Something is abstracted by something. The abstractor comes first, the thing being abstracted second, and the abstraction third.

14. There is always a direction, and is worth identifying.

15. Abstractions are free. They don't change anything until we change anything.

# the abstraction paradox

An abstraction can never be the thing it abstracts.

before observations

one-ness and two-ness yields three-ness every time.

# Examples

### the doll

A doll can be made of clay or plasitc. The doll is the shape and the abstraction. You can have one girl doll and one boy doll. One, girl, and boy are all abstractions. They are ideas we put words to so we can express them. Words are tools, and each word has a unique shape so we can tell them apart.

### ripples

Throwing a rock into a pond generates ripples. The throw must happen, the rock and pond must exist, the rock must hit the water, and only then will multiple ripples grow out from the point of contact. This order does not, and cannot change.
