# intro

An abstraction is any pattern used to represent another pattern, such as a name, a diagram, or a detailed description. Abstractions are meant to be used, and the use case determines the tolerance of how similar the expressions can be, and how they are physically implemented.



# the physics

All matter must have a shape. All shapes must be of matter. Abstractions are made of shapes. 

A doll can be made of clay or plasitc. The doll is the shape and the abstraction. You can have one girl doll and one boy doll. One is another shape and abstraction, as are girl and boy.

# the laws

1. Every abstraction has an implementation. It's physical composition.

2. Every abstraction is an expression. It's observed composition.

3. Abstractions are shapes. The observation is shaped.

4. Abstractions have meaning. The shape is known.

5. Abstractions travel. Shapes are communicated across sound, paper, wires, and screens.

6. Abstractions are used. By those that know them.

7. Abstractions are defined. By those that use them.

8. Abstractions evolve. With use.

9. An abstraction is an abstraction, and never what it represents.

10. Abstractions are enacted. They substitute the real thing and are made consequential.

An abstraction can never be the thing it abstracts.
